# TPS Global Context Menu

A richly featured context menu and note management system that attaches to every note link in the vault. Think of it as the primary interaction layer for creating, scheduling, tagging, and managing notes without ever leaving the current view.

---

## What It Does

### Context Menu
- Intercepts Obsidian's native file/link menus (`file-menu`, `url-menu`, editor context).
- `MenuController` builds the menu dynamically based on the target note's frontmatter.
- `MenuBuilder` and `PanelBuilder` assemble menu sections: actions, scheduling, tags, recurrence.
- `PersistentMenuManager` allows the menu to be pinned as a sidebar panel.

### Note Operations (`NoteOperationService`)
- Create child notes (with configurable templates and parent-link injection).
- Rename files using structured naming rules via `FileNamingService`.
- Move notes to type-specific folders.
- Archive or delete notes with confirmation.

### Scheduling & Recurrence
- `ScheduledModal` — sets a `scheduled` date frontmatter property.
- `RecurrenceService` + `RecurrenceModal` — defines repeating tasks (daily, weekly, monthly, custom).
- On task completion, auto-advances the scheduled date to the next recurrence and optionally clones the note.

### Checklist Management (`ChecklistHandler`)
- Reorders checklist items on drag or button press.
- Prompt to carry over incomplete checklist items to the next recurrence.
- `ChecklistPromptModal` handles the interactive selection.
- **Promote** — converts a checklist item into a linked child note using the configurable default status and priority (`defaultNewSubitemStatus` / `defaultNewSubitemPriority`).
- **Checklist completion property** — automatically writes a boolean frontmatter property (`allChecked` by default, configurable) that is `true` only when every checklist item in the note is checked `[x]` or canceled `[-]`. Unchecked `[ ]` and question-mark `[?]` items keep it `false`. Enable and configure the key under **Automation & Features → Checklists & Tasks** in settings.

### Bulk Edit (`BulkEditService`)
- Apply a frontmatter property change to many notes at once.
- Detect notes with missing or broken recurrence links and repair them.

### Tag Management
- `AddTagModal` — inline tag picker for adding/removing tags.
- `TagUtils` — reads and writes both frontmatter and inline tags cleanly.

### View Mode Manager
- Switches notes between Reading and Editing mode based on their status.
- Suppresses auto-switch for specific paths (e.g., daily notes).

### Mobile & Gesture Support
- `GestureHandler` — long-press on mobile triggers the context menu.
- Keyboard visibility detection suppresses both the inline context menu bar and the subitems panel when the soft keyboard is open (controlled by the **Suppress menu on mobile keyboard** setting).

## Known Issues & Planned Improvements

### Critical
- **`sheduledEnd` typo** — `FrontmatterData.sheduledEnd` in `types.ts` is misspelled (should be `scheduledEnd`). Any code reading `fm.scheduledEnd` gets `undefined` silently. Fix: rename field + update all references.
- **`tag-utils.ts` 3rd copy** — A third copy of tag normalization logic lives here alongside copies in Calendar-Base and Controller. Should be consolidated; Controller is the canonical source.

### Medium
- **`app.workspace.activeLeaf` (deprecated)** — Replace with `getActiveViewOfType()` or `app.workspace.activeEditor` for canvas-awareness.
- **Inline CSS in `settings-tab.ts`** — The `createSection` / `createPopout` helpers use `element.style.*` directly. Move to CSS classes in `styles-ui.css`.
- **No view-scoped hotkeys** — Inline panel navigation has no keyboard shortcuts. Use `View.scope` (public since Obsidian v1.5.7) to register panel-scoped keys.
- **`PanelBuilder.ts` ~3965 lines** — Still very large; consider splitting into render, state, and event sub-modules.
- **3 toggles in one Setting row** — The "Enable in specific views" row has 3 unlabeled toggles; refactor to individual named settings for clarity.

### Low
- **No view mode rule tester** — Rule builder has no "test against current file" button.
- **Archive tag has no autocomplete** — Should suggest from `app.metadataCache.getTags()`.
- **Encoding artifact** — Line 17 of `persistent-menu-manager.ts` contains `â€"` (UTF-8 mojibake for `–`). Fix: correct the character.
- **Canvas context menu** — GCM actions fail on Canvas embedded file cards because `activeLeaf` is the canvas. Use `app.workspace.activeEditor` (v1.1.1+) to fix.

### Planned API Improvements
- Implement `Plugin#onExternalSettingsChange()` to reload settings when synced by Obsidian Sync.
- Implement `Plugin#onUserEnable()` for first-time folder setup.
- Use `vault.getFileByPath()` instead of `getAbstractFileByPath()` (cleaner since v1.5.7).
- Use `leaf.isDeferred` / `leaf.loadIfDeferred()` when iterating leaves (Obsidian v1.7.2+).
- Add `processFrontMatter()` check — verify all frontmatter writes use the atomic API.

## Integration with TPS Suite

| Plugin | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| TPS-Controller | Optional — reads device role for sync-aware behavior |
| TPS-NNC | Independent |
| TPS-Notifier | Independent — GCM's snooze modal writes frontmatter that Notifier reads |

## Shared Utility Files (Intentional Duplication)

The following source files are deliberately copied from TPS-Controller. Each plugin is self-contained to avoid build-time cross-plugin dependencies. When updating logic, mirror the change to all copies:

| File | Also in |
|------|---------|
| `src/utils/tag-utils.ts` | TPS-Controller, TPS-Calendar-Base |
| `src/ui/list-renderer.ts` | TPS-Controller, TPS-Calendar-Base |
| `src/ui/section-helpers.ts` | TPS-Controller, TPS-Calendar-Base |
